[Hikaya](https://hikaya.io) helps organizations tell their stories through data and technology. We work alongside leading nonprofits worldwide to assess their digital needs based on the principles of digital development and lay the groundwork for their digital transformation roadmap.

We aim to achieve this by introducing a set of integrated tools that re-engineer how data is used in organizations. By building open source solutions on common data standards, we improve the delivery of goods and services to those most in need while making reporting to funders more transparent.

## Meet the team

We are a team of data scientists, designers, humanitarians, and software engineers who have lived and worked in some of the most challenging parts of the world.
